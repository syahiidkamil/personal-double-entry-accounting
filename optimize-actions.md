# Optimization Actions

## Components Added
- `SearchBar` - A reusable search input component with icon and optional button
- `DataTable` - A flexible data table component with loading, empty, and stale state handling
- `EnhancedPagination` - A pagination component with first/last page support

## Code Optimizations
- Simplified and optimized `useSearch` hook with clearer naming and documentation
- Refactored UserManagementPage to use reusable components
- Refactored InvitationCodesPage to use reusable components 
- Improved component prop documentation

## Files to Delete
The following files are now redundant and can be safely deleted:

1. `src/features/auth/components/LoginForm.js` (replaced by LoginPage.jsx)
2. `src/features/auth/components/RegisterForm.js` (replaced by RegisterPage.jsx)
3. `src/shared/utils/currencies.js` (duplicates functionality in currencyService.js)

## Merged Functionality
- Currency functionality: The utilities in `shared/utils/currencies.js` have been consolidated into `shared/services/currencyService.js`

## Updated Files
- `src/shared/hooks/useSearch.js`
- `src/features/admin/users/UserManagementPage.jsx`
- `src/features/admin/invitation-codes/InvitationCodesPage.jsx`

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders in tables by using memoization
- Optimized search experience with debouncing and deferred values
- Improved stale state UI feedback during data fetching
